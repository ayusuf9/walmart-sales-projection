# Walmart Sales Project

by Yusuf Abdulwahab

Based on my overall analysis on this project, I believe business stakeholders can gain significant value from their data. This would ensure that sales projections are not only based on historical performance but also provide valuable insights into potential future outcomes.

## Project Components

* `Data transformation`: This entails converting, cleansing, and structuring data into a usable format for data visualization and analysis.
* `Data visualization`: This entails building charts using seaborn to identify data trends and relationships that lead to valuable insights.
* `Sales forecast modeling`: This entails building a predictive model to forecast weekly sales.

## Required Python Libraries

* `pandas`: This is to explore, clean, transform, and analyze data.
* `numpy`: This is to perform mathematical operations on the data.
* `seaborn`: This is to build graphs for data visualization.
* `matplotlib.pyplot`: This is to serve as a backend for seaborn to draw graphs.

## Required Python Modules

* `sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder`: This is to encode category variables in numerical format.
* `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`: This is to train a random forest model to predict weekly sales.
